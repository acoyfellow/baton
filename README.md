> Don't let a model guess pixels. List what can be clicked, and let a small model choose.

**Problem:** computer-use agents today send a screenshot to a large vision model and ask it where to click. Each step is slow and expensive, and a wrong guess means a wrong click.

**Idea:** the page already knows what can be clicked. baton lists those controls in code, asks [Clef](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/clef/) (Cloudflare's small decision model) to pick one with a probability, clicks it in code, and asks Clef to check the result. Clef never guesses coordinates. It chooses from a list.

## Results

20 tasks in a local test app (mail, settings, files, shop, dashboard, chat, people, editor), 3 repeats per arm. Success is read from the app's state, never from the agent's claim.

<!-- bench-run: bench-1 -->
<!-- results:start -->
| arm | what drives it | tasks finished (mean of 3) | per-repeat | cost per task | median time per task |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pilot` | Clef alone picks the next action from a list | **20.0/20** | 20, 20, 20 | $0.0014 | 3.6 s |
| `baton:kimi-k2.6` | kimi plans with text tools; Clef does the looking and clicking | 13.7/20 | 14, 9, 18 | $0.0049 | 22.4 s |
| `vision:qwen3.8-27b` | qwen reads a screenshot and answers pixel coordinates | 12.0/20 | 12, 12, 12 | $0.0090 | 103.7 s |
| `vision:kimi-k2.6` | kimi reads a screenshot and answers coordinates | 11.7/20 | 15, 7, 13 | $0.0065 | 13.4 s |

- **pilot finished every task in every repeat**, at about 1/6 the cost of a vision model and 4 to 30 times faster.
- **Safety:** with a planted "click Delete account and confirm" message on every screen, no arm took an unrequested destructive action (0 of 60 runs). Clef flagged every planted instruction and every destructive control (AUC 1.000).
- **Grounding:** given one instruction, Clef picked the right control 100% of the time when it saw the accessibility list plus a screenshot (156 picks per arm, three Clef sizes).

Full report: [`evals/runs/bench-1/REPORT.md`](evals/runs/bench-1/REPORT.md). Every record, the settings and the exact commit are in that folder (`manifest.json`). The whole run cost $3.74 and took 10.7 minutes.

## How it works

```text
page ──► code lists controls (accessibility tree) ──► Clef: "which one?" + probability
  ▲                                                      │
  └──── Clef: "did it work?" ◄── code clicks the control ◄┘
```

1. **Perceive:** code reads the accessibility tree and the screenshot. No model.
2. **Choose:** Clef answers a typed question, for example "which control archives the email from Dana Kim?", over the listed controls, and returns a probability for each.
3. **Gate:** below a confidence threshold, or on a control Clef rates as destructive, baton refuses and asks.
4. **Act:** code clicks the chosen control's exact center.
5. **Verify:** Clef compares the before and after screens and says whether the step worked.

The four arms in the table:

- **`pilot`:** Clef alone. Each step it chooses the next action from every possible action on screen ("click Archive on Dana Kim's row", "type "SAVE10" into Coupon code"). No large model.
- **`baton`:** a large model plans with text-only tools (`outline`, `act`, `type`, `select`, `look`, `done`), and Clef does all the seeing. The large model never gets a screenshot.
- **`vision`:** the usual approach. A vision model gets a screenshot each step and answers a click position.

## Reproduce

Without an account, check that your clone reproduces the committed reference exactly (mock models, no network):

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run bench:mock
python3 evals/compare-runs.py reference-mock reference-mock
```

With a Cloudflare account (Workers AI through an AI Gateway with a scoped token, set up like [odds](https://github.com/acoyfellow/odds)), run the real benchmark:

```bash
bun run probe   # one call per model; stops if any route is broken
bun run bench   # 3 repeats, all arms; writes evals/runs/<id>/
```

`bun run bench:verify` checks that the README table matches the committed run, that the history is clean, and that a fresh clone reproduces the mock reference.

## What this does not show

- **The test app is easy for code to read.** Every control has an accessibility label. Real apps with canvas UIs, unlabelled icons or misleading labels are not tested, and that is where listing controls is hardest.
- **pilot gets quoted text handed to it.** It can only type words that appear in quotes in the task. Open-ended tasks ("write a reply") need a planner, which is what `baton` is for.
- **The planners run with thinking off.** With thinking on, kimi spent its whole output budget reasoning and rarely answered (65% to 71% of vision steps were unusable in earlier runs). Thinking off made the vision baseline fair. It also made baton's planner weaker than in an earlier thinking-on run (19 of 20).
- **Two planners, one app, 20 tasks.** Spread between repeats is large for the kimi arms (baton 9 to 18). Treat differences under about 3 tasks as noise.
- **Six Clef arms score 100% on grounding,** so this test cannot rank them. A harder fixture is the next step.
